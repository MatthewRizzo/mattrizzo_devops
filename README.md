# Matt Rizzo Devops

Repository containing all things related to CI and devops for any code I develop

## WHY

Because you want a portable way to manage you git environment.

## Install

All you need to do is run `sudo bootstrap.sh`.

## TODO

* Get the install of pre-push hooks through
    [setup_hooks.sh](hooks/pre_push/README.md) to work.
* Move all non-system dependencies into the proper dependency file
  * i.e. take poetry version out of [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh)
* Add a python typing hook
